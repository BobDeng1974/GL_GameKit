* Add a seperate shader for instanced rendering of static objects maybe
    - Probably shouldnt do this for dynamic objects because bones take a lot of memory

* ADD TEXTURE COMPRESSION!!!!!!
    - DXT1, DX3, AND DXT5 VERY CRITICAL!!!

* Add material (float array) cap to the static, dynamic, scene, etc. renderers

* Perhaps turn the blending addition of the light and diffuse texture into a texture combine filter

* Make the physics configuration namespace into a class so that you can have different models for softbody and dynamics worlds!!!

* REIMPLEMENT COMPOUND COLLIDERS
